## Notes

This timed code quiz was very challenging, but also a lot of fun to create. I learned my lesson on the previous assignment and used the "console.log" much more and conquered one function at a time. This allowed for much faster progress, as I was able to debug issues as they arose. I chose to use the Bootstrap CSS Framework again, as it allows for a very responsive application from the ground up.

LESSONS LEARNED: I have a much better comprehension of javascript now after this assignment. I was able to draw on knowledge from the previous "Password Generator" assignment as well, which made things go a bit smoother. Initially, I had this application set up with 2 HTML pages and tried to use 2 javascript files. This quickly became frustrating, so I took several steps back and pushed everything into single HTML and JS files. It took some extra work, but depending on the application, I would probably try to use single files again.
